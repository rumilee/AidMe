# ðŸš‘    AidMe
AidMe is a first-aid medical assistance app targeted towards informing K-12 students of basic interventions for common emergency situations.
Having seen medical emergencies occur in the classroom, I wanted to create an app that would help educate and empower my peers in similar situations.Â 

Representing Congressman Austin Scott, AidMe won Georgia District 8â€™s 2018 Congressional App Challenge which resulted in news coverage and a pitch opportunity at the House of Code event in Washington DC.
